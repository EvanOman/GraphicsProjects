# GraphicsProjects
This repository holds all of my graphics coursework for my graduate Computer Graphics course at the University of MN Duluth.

#Notes:
This repository is not as much meant to be an exhibition of my work as much as it is a backup of old project for the following reasons:

-MOST of the heft of these projects is the GLFW source code, for which I obviously claim no credit.

-Additionally, a large portion of the setup code was provided by my instructor, David Schroeder. The goal of most of the assignments was constrained to some specific graphics topic for which we filled in the appropriate code. For example we implemented the fragment and vertex shaders for a shading assignment but we were provided with the objects and the background code so that we could easily communicate with the graphics card.
